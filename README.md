# RawHash2 Overview

RawHash2 is a hash-based mechanism to map raw nanopore signals to a reference genome in real-time. To achieve this, it 1) generates an index from the reference genome and 2) efficiently and accurately maps the raw signals to the reference genome such that it can match the throughput of nanopore sequencing even when analyzing large genomes (e.g., human genome.

Rawsamble is a mechanism that finds overlaps betweel raw signals without a reference genome (all-vs-all overlapping). The overlap information is generated in a PAF output and can be used by assemblers such as `miniasm` to construct *de novo* assemblies.

Below figure shows the overview of the steps that RawHash2 takes to find matching regions between a reference genome and a raw nanopore signal.

<p align="center" width="100%">

</p>

To efficiently identify similarities between a reference genome and reads, RawHash has two steps, similar to regular read mapping tools, 1) indexing and 2) mapping. The indexing step generates hash values from the expected signal representation of a reference genome and stores them in a hash table. In the mapping step, RawHash generates the hash values from raw signals and queries the hash table generated in the indexing step to find seed matches. To map the raw signal to a reference genome, RawHash performs chaining over the seed matches.

RawHash2 can be used to map reads from **FAST5, POD5, SLOW5, or BLOW5** files to a reference genome in sequence format. **POD5 is the recommended format** as it is the current default for Oxford Nanopore sequencers.

RawHash performs real-time mapping of nanopore raw signals. When the prefix of reads can be mapped to a reference genome, RawHash will stop mapping and provide the mapping information in PAF format. We follow the similar PAF template used in [UNCALLED](https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED) and [Sigmap](https://github.com/haowenz/sigmap) to report the mapping information.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| C++ compiler | GCC 11+ (`g++` 11 or later) | Xcode Command Line Tools (Apple Clang) |
| CMake | 3.16+ (for CMake build only) | 3.16+ (for CMake build only) |
| GNU Make | Required | Required |

> **Note:** When POD5 support is enabled (the default), all source files are compiled as C++ and linked against POD5 v0.3.36's pre-built static libraries. These libraries require GCC 11 or later on Linux. GCC 8.x is known to fail at link time. If you cannot upgrade GCC, you can disable POD5 with `make NOPOD5=1` to compile with any C99-compatible compiler, but POD5 signal input will not be available.

## Quick Start

* Clone the code from its GitHub repository (`--recursive` must be used):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/STORMgroup/RawHash2.git rawhash2
cd rawhash2
```

* **Recommended: Build with CMake** (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) above):

```bash
make cmake
```

* **Alternative: Build with Make only** (no CMake required, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)):

```bash
make
```

Both methods produce the binary at `bin/rawhash2`. By default, RawHash2 compiles with **POD5 support only**. To enable HDF5/FAST5 or SLOW5/BLOW5 support, see the section below.

## Compiling with HDF5, SLOW5, and POD5

RawHash2 provides two build systems. The recommended approach is CMake, which provides the most flexibility. The standalone Makefile is an alternative for systems without CMake.

### Using CMake (Recommended)

**Default build** (POD5 only):

```bash
make cmake
```

**Enable additional formats:**

```bash
# Enable all three formats (HDF5, SLOW5, POD5)
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_HDF5=ON -DENABLE_SLOW5=ON"

# Enable only HDF5 and POD5
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_HDF5=ON"

# Enable only SLOW5 and POD5
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_SLOW5=ON"

# Disable POD5, enable HDF5 and SLOW5
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_HDF5=ON -DENABLE_SLOW5=ON -DENABLE_POD5=OFF"
```

**Debug, profiling, and sanitizer builds:**

```bash
# Debug build with debug symbols (-O2 -g)
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"

# Enable profiling (-g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DPROFILERH=1)
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_PROFILING=ON"

# Enable AddressSanitizer
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_ASAN=ON"

# Enable ThreadSanitizer
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_TSAN=ON"

# Combine options
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_ASAN=ON -DENABLE_HDF5=ON"
```

**Or invoke CMake directly** for full control:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DENABLE_HDF5=ON -DENABLE_SLOW5=ON ..
cmake --build . -j4
cp src/rawhash2 ../bin/
```

**Use system-installed HDF5** instead of building from submodule:

```bash
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_HDF5=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_HDF5=ON"
```

### Using Make (No CMake Required)

**Default build** (POD5 only):

```bash
make
```

**Disable/enable formats:**

```bash
# Disable POD5 (compile with no external signal format libraries)
make NOPOD5=1

# Enable HDF5 along with POD5
make NOHDF5=0

# Enable SLOW5 along with POD5
make NOSLOW5=0

# Enable all formats
make NOHDF5=0 NOSLOW5=0
```

**Debug, profiling, and sanitizer builds:**

```bash
# Debug build with AddressSanitizer (-O2 -fsanitize=address -g)
make DEBUG=1

# Enable profiling (-g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -DPROFILERH=1)
make PROFILE=1

# Enable AddressSanitizer without full debug mode
make asan=1

# Enable ThreadSanitizer
make tsan=1

# Combine options
make DEBUG=1 NOHDF5=0
```

**Rebuild without recompiling external dependencies:**

```bash
make subset
```

## MinKNOW Integration and Adaptive Sampling

RawHash2 supports **real-time adaptive sampling** from Oxford Nanopore sequencers via the MinKNOW gRPC API. Signal chunks stream in as reads are being sequenced, RawHash2 maps each chunk incrementally using multi-threaded parallel processing, and mapping decisions (keep or eject) are sent back to the sequencer.

Three signal sources are supported — all use the same `--live` interface:

| Mode | Signal source | Use case |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Pod5 replay** | Python replay server replays a real pod5 file over gRPC | Deterministic validation and benchmarking |
| **Icarust** | [Icarust](https://github.com/LooseLab/Icarust) synthesizes signal from a reference | Integration testing with simulated hardware |
| **Real MinKNOW** | Physical nanopore sequencer | Production adaptive sampling |

### Building with gRPC support

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (Linux via conda)
conda create -n rawhash2-live cmake make cxx-compiler grpcio grpcio-tools libgrpc protobuf
conda activate rawhash2-live

# macOS alternative: brew install grpc cmake

# 2. Build
make cmake CMAKE_OPTS="-DENABLE_GRPC=ON"
```

### Quick start: pod5 replay

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start replay server
pip install grpcio grpcio-tools pod5
python3 pod5_replay_server.py --pod5 reads.pod5 --port 10111 --mode uncalibrated

# Terminal 2: Index (one-time) + map live
bin/rawhash2 -x viral -p extern/kmer_models/legacy/legacy_r9.4_180mv_450bps_6mer/template_median68pA.model \
  -d ref.idx ref.fa
bin/rawhash2 --live --live-port 10111 --live-uncalibrated -x viral -t 16 ref.idx > live.paf
```

### Quick start: real MinKNOW

```bash
bin/rawhash2 --live \
  --live-host sequencer01 --live-port 8004 \
  --live-tls --live-tls-cert /opt/ont/minknow/conf/rpc-certs/ca.crt \
  --live-last-channel 512 \
  -x r10fast -t 16 ref.idx > live.paf
```

For the complete guide covering all three modes, installation, configuration, validation, threading architecture, and troubleshooting, see **[live/LIVE.md](live/LIVE.md)**.

# Usage

## Getting help

```bash
rawhash2 -h   # print full usage and options
```

## Indexing

Indexing is similar to minimap2's usage. Pore models are located under `./extern`. You can jump directly to mapping (the index is built on-the-fly), but pre-building is recommended for real-time applications.

```bash
# R9.4 indexing
rawhash2 -d ref.ind \
  -p extern/kmer_models/legacy/legacy_r9.4_180mv_450bps_6mer/template_median68pA.model \
  -t 32 ref.fasta

# R10.4.1 indexing (different pore model; pick the chemistry preset)
rawhash2 -d ref.ind \
  -p extern/local_kmer_models/uncalled_r1041_model_only_means.txt \
  -x r10 -t 32 ref.fasta
```

> **Note on R10 chemistry:** Use `-x r10` for non-human R10 references and `-x r10fast` for human R10 references (these subsume the chemistry knobs that the legacy `--r10` flag set on top of mapping presets — see [Mapping](#mapping) below). The `--r10` flag is still accepted as a backward-compat alias for `-x r10`.

## Mapping

Inputs can be directories of signal files (FAST5, POD5, SLOW5, BLOW5), individual files, or glob patterns. When there are many files (thousands+), pass directories rather than individual files. Use `-o mapping.paf` to write output to a file, or redirect stdout.

**Mapping presets:**

R9.4 mapping presets (use the R9.4 pore model):

| Preset | Use case | Flag |
|--------|----------|------|
| `viral` | Viral genomes | `-x viral` |
| `sensitive` | Small-medium genomes (<500M) | `-x sensitive` |
| `fast` | Large genomes (500M-5G) | `-x fast` |
| `faster` | Very large metagenomes (>10G), uses minimizer seeding | `-x faster` |

R10.x mapping presets (use the R10 pore model). These bundle the chemistry knobs (k-mer size, segmentation thresholds, sample rate, etc.) with a sensitive- or fast-shape quantization tuned for the typical reference size in each case, so you do not need to pass `--r10` separately.

| Preset | Use case | Flag |
|--------|----------|------|
| `r10`     | R10 chemistry, sensitive-shape quantization (non-human R10 references) | `-x r10`     |
| `r10fast` | R10 chemistry, fast-shape quantization tuned for human R10 references  | `-x r10fast` |

> **Backward compatibility:** the `--r10` flag is preserved as an alias for `-x r10`. Note that `-x fast --r10` now resolves to `-x r10` (sensitive shape) — for the d8-style human-R10 settings use `-x r10fast` explicitly.

**Examples:**

```bash
# R9.4, viral preset
rawhash2 -t 32 -x viral ref.ind test/data/d1_sars-cov-2_r94/fast5_files > mapping.paf

# R10.4 / R10.4.1 non-human (e.g., d6, d7, d9, d10): -x r10
rawhash2 -t 32 -x r10 ref.ind test/data/d6_ecoli_r104/fast5_files > mapping.paf

# R10.4.1 human (e.g., d8): -x r10fast
rawhash2 -t 32 -x r10fast ref.ind test/data/d8_human_hg002_r1041/pod5_files > mapping.paf
```

The output is in a modified PAF format used by [Uncalled](https://github.com/skovaka/UNCALLED).

# Functionalities

RawHash2 provides several key functionalities beyond basic read mapping. This section describes each feature and how to enable it.

## R10.4.1 Support

RawHash2 supports R10.4.1 (and R10 in general) nanopore data. R10 uses 9-mer pore models (vs 6-mer for R9.4) and different device parameters (e.g., different sampling rate). Pick the right preset for your reference, and pair it with the R10 pore model:

- `-x r10` — R10 chemistry, sensitive-shape quantization. Use for non-human R10 references (e.g., bacterial, fungal, small eukaryotic).
- `-x r10fast` — R10 chemistry, fast-shape quantization tuned for human R10 references.

Both presets imply the chemistry settings; you do not need to also pass `--r10`. The legacy `--r10` flag is still accepted as a backward-compat alias for `-x r10`. See the [Indexing](#indexing) and [Mapping](#mapping) sections for examples.

## Signal Alignment (RawAlign)

RawHash2 integrates DTW-based signal alignment as proposed in [RawAlign](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3520669). This refines mapping accuracy by aligning the raw signal against the reference signal using Dynamic Time Warping.

To use signal alignment, the index must be built with `--store-sig` to store reference signal values:

```bash
# Build index with reference signal stored
rawhash2 -d ref.ind -p pore_model.txt --store-sig -t 32 ref.fasta

# Map with DTW-based chain evaluation and CIGAR output
rawhash2 -t 32 --dtw-evaluate-chains --dtw-output-cigar ref.ind pod5_files/ > mapping.paf
```

DTW options control the alignment behavior:
- `--dtw-border-constraint`: alignment scope (`global`, `sparse`, or `local`; default: `sparse`)
- `--dtw-fill-method`: matrix computation (`full` or `banded[=FRAC]`; default: `banded`)
- `--dtw-match-bonus`: match score bonus (default: 0.4)
- `--dtw-min-score`: minimum DTW score to report a mapping (default: 20.0)

## External Segmentation

By default, RawHash2 uses a built-in t-test peak detector to segment raw signal into events. You can instead provide pre-computed segmentation data using one of three mutually exclusive options:

| Option | Input format (tab-separated, one line per read) | Use case |
|--------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `--peaks-file` | `read_id  peak1 peak2 ... peakN` | Pre-computed segment boundaries |
| `--events-file` | `read_id  ev1 ev2 ... evN` | Pre-computed event-level values |
| `--moves-file` | `read_id  mv:B:c,STRIDE,0,1,...  ts:i:OFFSET` | Dorado move tables (neural-network segmentation) |

**Extract move tables from a dorado BAM:**

```bash
# Use the provided helper script (requires samtools)
test/scripts/extract_moves_from_bam.sh reads_dorado.bam > moves.tsv

# Then map with dorado's segmentation
rawhash2 --moves-file moves.tsv -p pore_model.txt -d ref.ind ref.fasta pod5_files/
```

The `--min-seg-length` and `--max-seg-length` parameters control the minimum and maximum allowed segment lengths (in samples), regardless of which segmentation method is used. The `--sig-diff INT` parameter performs homopolymer compression on quantized event values: consecutive events whose quantized bucket indices differ by at most INT are skipped. The default is `--sig-diff 0` (skip only exact same-bucket events). Pass `--sig-diff -1` to disable the filter entirely (auto-set to `-1` when `--moves-file` or `--peaks-file` is used). A similar homopolymer-compression strategy is used in Sigmap and Sigmoni.

## Sequence Until (Real-Time Abundance Estimation)

Sequence Until provides real-time abundance estimation during sequencing. It periodically estimates the composition of the sequenced sample and can be used to determine when sufficient data has been collected.

```bash
rawhash2 -t 32 --sequence-until ref.ind pod5_files/ > mapping.paf
```

Key parameters:
- `--threshold`: outlier distance threshold (default: 1.5)
- `--n-samples`: number of previous estimations to compare (default: 5)
- `--test-frequency`: re-estimate every N reads (default: 500)
- `--min-reads`: minimum reads before first estimate (default: 500)

## Contamination Analysis

The `--depletion` flag provides a high-precision mode suitable for contamination detection and abundance analysis. It adjusts internal parameters to prioritize precision over recall.

```bash
rawhash2 -t 32 -x sensitive --depletion ref.ind pod5_files/ > mapping.paf
```

## Rawsamble (for overlapping and assembly construction)

Rawsamble performs all-vs-all raw signal overlapping for *de novo* assembly. Build an index from signals, then overlap:

```bash
# Index
rawhash2 -x ava -p extern/kmer_models/legacy/legacy_r9.4_180mv_450bps_6mer/template_median68pA.model \
  -d ava.ind -t 32 test/data/d3_yeast_r94/fast5_files/

# Overlap
rawhash2 -x ava -t 32 ava.ind test/data/d3_yeast_r94/fast5_files/ > ava.paf
```

**Rawsamble presets:**

R9.4 overlap presets (use the R9.4 pore model):

| Preset | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| `ava` | All-vs-all overlapping (default) |
| `ava-sensitive` | More sensitive; may produce longer unitigs in downstream assembly |
| `ava-viral` | Very small genomes (e.g., viral) |
| `ava-large` | Large genomes (>10Gb) |

R10.x overlap presets (use the R10 pore model). Same shape as the R9.4 family above, with R10 chemistry and an R10-tuned quantizer baked in:

| Preset | Use case |
|--------|----------|
| `r10ava`           | All-vs-all R10 overlapping |
| `r10ava-sensitive` | More sensitive R10 overlapping |
| `r10ava-viral`     | Very small R10 genomes |
| `r10ava-large`     | Large R10 genomes (>10Gb) |

The legacy form `-x ava --r10` still works and resolves to `-x r10ava`.

## Potential issues you may encounter during mapping

It is possible that your reads in fast5 files are compressed with the [VBZ compression](https://github.com/nanoporetech/vbz_compression) from Nanopore. Then you have to download the proper HDF5 plugin from [here](https://github.com/nanoporetech/vbz_compression/releases) and make sure it can be found by your HDF5 library:

```bash
export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=/path/to/hdf5/plugins/lib
```

If you have conda you can simply install the following package (`ont_vbz_hdf_plugin`) in your environment and use rawhash2 while the environment is active:

```bash
conda install ont_vbz_hdf_plugin
```
# Reproducing the results

Please follow the instructions in the [README](test/README.md) file in [test](./test/).

# Upcoming Features

* Policy-based adaptive sampling decisions (target vs. non-target classification, abundance thresholds).
* Sequence Until + live mode integration for real-time abundance monitoring.
* Ability to specify even/odd channels to eject the reads only from these specified channels.
* Please create issues if you want to see more features that can make RawHash2 easily integratable with nanopore sequencers for any use case.
